# PNA_Clamp_Testing
This is the repository of materials for project assessing impacts of PNA clamp concentration, DNA input concentration, and root/leaf tissue on microbial amplicon sequencing.

Specifically, the goal of this project is to determine whether the addition of PNA (peptide-nucleic acid) clamps (Lundberg et al., Nature Methods, 2013) reduce plant-based 16S amplicons (chloroplast and mitochondrial sequences) to a level at which it is economically feasible to do 16S amplicon sequencing using plant tissue and get sufficient number of microbial reads for endophyte community analysis.
